Preprocessor : The task of collecting the source program is sometimes entrusted to a separate program, called a preprocessor.

Compiler: Compilers are computer programs that translate a program written in one language into a program written in another language. detects errors

Assembler: assembly languages are designed to be readable by humans creates object code

Linker: Large programs are often  compiled in pieces.
So, the relocatable machine code may have to be linked together with other relocatable object files and library files into the code that runs on the machine.
The linker resolves external memory addresses, where the code in one file may refer to a location in another file.

Loader: The loader then puts together all the executable object files into memory for execution.

Interpreter : Interpreter directly executes the operations specified in the source program on inputs supplied by the user

**To achieve faster processing of inputs to outputs,**
**some Java compilers, called just-in-time compilers,**
**translate the bytecodes into machine language**
**immediately before they run the intermediate program**
**to process the input.**
